All projects carried out in my Flit program
#Market basket analysis was carried to determine items that are more likely to be purchased together using the apriori algorithm. Apriori algorithm works by determing the the support(by
comapring candidate support with minimum support and generating each candidate set) tp determine frequent item sets and usimg association rules and determining its confidence.
The datasets was  imported in my jupyter notebook and read using pandas. Data is viewd and missing data checked out for. Consequently, exploratory data analysis was carried to understand the 
corpus more andtransforemed for easy analysis. 
The apriori algorithm and asoociation rule algorithm was imported from the mlxtend library and used to determine frequent item sets after which association rules was set at a confidence. 
The result showed frequent items as whole milk and yoghurt and whole milk and roll buns
